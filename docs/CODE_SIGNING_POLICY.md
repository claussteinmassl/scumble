# Code signing policy

Scumble's Windows installer (`Scumble Setup <version>.exe`) is built by GitHub Actions from
the source in this repository and published on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DenRakEiw/scumble/releases). This page is the code
signing policy the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/terms) asks an open source
project to publish. It describes who may change the code, who approves a signed release and
what the program sends over the network.

**Status.** Releases up to 0.1.x are **not signed**. Once the project has visible use, the
maintainer applies at the SignPath Foundation; from the first signed release on, the
attribution below applies and the SmartScreen paragraph in the README goes away. A Microsoft
Store package is planned before that, as the signed way in for whoever needs one (below).

> Free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io), certificate by
> [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org).

**Until then, the Microsoft Store is the signed way in** (decided 2026-09-23 with the user).
The SignPath Foundation wants a project with visible use behind it, which takes as long as it
takes; a user who needs a signed installer today should not have to wait for that. A package
submitted to the Microsoft Store as **MSIX** is **re-signed by Microsoft** after certification,
so no certificate has to be bought or held, and since September 2025 for individuals (May 2026
for companies) a developer account costs nothing - an identity check replaces the fee.

What that does and does not do:

- The Store copy is signed by Microsoft and installs without a SmartScreen warning.
- **The installer on GitHub stays unsigned**, and its SmartScreen paragraph in the README
  stays with it. The Store signature belongs to the Store package alone.
- Submitting the Win32 installer to the Store instead of an MSIX does not help: that route
  requires the `.exe` to be signed by the publisher before submission.
- So the Store is a second channel, not a replacement for SignPath, and it does not change
  anything written below.

What the MSIX build has to get right (built on 2026-09-23 and checked without an install; [STORE.md](STORE.md) has how, and what still has to run on an installed package):

- **`runFullTrust`.** An AppContainer package cannot reach `127.0.0.1`, which would cut the
  app off from the user's ComfyUI. Full trust keeps loopback, the file mirror and the helper
  models' runtime working.
- **No self-update in that build.** The Store updates its own copy; `electron-updater` and
  the Updates section have to know they are not in charge there.
- **The MCP registration** must name the execution alias, not the install path: a Store
  install lives under `WindowsApps` in a folder that carries the version and changes with
  every update. The AppImage needed the same treatment in 0.1.26.
- **To be tested, not assumed:** the single-instance named pipe, the plugin folder, and every
  path under `%APPDATA%` (the keys through safeStorage, the autosave, the local file mirror)
  under a packaged app's path redirection.
- **The licence is not an obstacle.** GPL-3.0 apps are in the Store (VLC, Krita); the
  publisher supplies their own licence terms, and the source is public either way.

## macOS

The macOS build (`Scumble-<version>-arm64.dmg` and `.zip`, Apple Silicon only) is built by the `macos` job of
`.github/workflows/build.yml` on a GitHub-hosted `macos-latest` runner, or locally with `npm run dist:mac`. The
`build.mac` block of `package.json` sets the targets (dmg and zip, arm64), the hardened runtime and
`build/entitlements.mac.plist` (JIT and unsigned executable memory, which Electron needs). Gatekeeper blocks a
download that is not signed with a Developer ID Application certificate and notarized by Apple, so a macOS build
meant for other people has to be both. This has nothing to do with the SignPath Foundation, which signs Windows
binaries.

**Locally.** electron-builder signs with a "Developer ID Application" identity from the keychain. It notarizes when
`APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE` names a profile made with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`, or when `APPLE_ID`,
`APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` are set. The first time, `codesign` may ask for access to the
certificate's key in the keychain; answer *Always Allow* once. Check the result with
`codesign --verify --deep --strict dist/mac-arm64/Scumble.app`,
`spctl -a -vv -t exec dist/mac-arm64/Scumble.app` and `xcrun stapler validate` on the dmg.

**In CI.** The job needs five repository secrets:

| Secret | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `CSC_LINK` | the Developer ID Application certificate with its private key, as a `.p12` file, base64-encoded |
| `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | the password of that `.p12` |
| `APPLE_ID` | the Apple ID used for notarization |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | an app-specific password of that Apple ID |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | the Apple Developer team ID |

**Without the secrets** (forks, pull requests, a repository that has no Apple account) the job builds an **unsigned**
dmg and zip with `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` and keeps them as the workflow artifact `Scumble-macos`; nothing is
attached to a release. The job treats the secrets as present when `CSC_LINK` and `APPLE_ID` are both set (`HAS_SIGNING`
in the workflow). **With them**, it signs and notarizes, and on a `v<version>` tag it also publishes the dmg, the zip
and `latest-mac.yml` to the draft release the `draft` job made. The Windows and Linux jobs do not depend on any of this.

**Updates.** The macOS app does not update itself: the updater is off there and Settings › Updates says that new
versions are downloaded from GitHub Releases. `latest-mac.yml` is published with the release, so turning the updater
on later is a change in `electron/main/updater.js`, not in the release.

## Roles

| Role | Who |
| --- | --- |
| Committers and reviewers | Members of the [DenRakEiw/scumble](https://github.com/DenRakEiw/scumble) repository with write permission: [DenRakEiw](https://github.com/DenRakEiw) |
| Approvers | [DenRakEiw](https://github.com/DenRakEiw) |

Contributions from outside the team arrive as pull requests and are reviewed and merged by a
committer. Every release is approved for signing by hand by an approver; nothing is signed
automatically.

## How a release is built

- A release is a git tag `v<version>` on `main` that matches `version` in `package.json`.
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds the installer on a GitHub-hosted `windows-latest`
  runner from that tag with `npm ci` and `electron-builder`. Nobody builds release binaries
  on a private machine.
- The release notes are that version's section of `CHANGELOG.md`; a missing section fails the
  build.
- Product name (`Scumble`), file description and product version are set by electron-builder
  from `package.json` and are the same in every artifact of a release.
- The signing request will be submitted from that workflow (SignPath's GitHub Action) and
  approved by an approver before the signed installer replaces the unsigned one in the
  release.

## Privacy policy

This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless
specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it.

In detail, Scumble talks to these systems, and to nothing else:

- **Your ComfyUI server**, at the address you enter in Settings › ComfyUI, when you run a
  local recipe, a helper node, or test the connection.
- **An API provider** (ToAPIs, Google, OpenAI, Black Forest Labs, fal.ai, Replicate, WaveSpeedAI,
  Comfy Cloud, OpenRouter, BytePlus ModelArk, Anthropic), only when you run a recipe or a prompt upsampling that names it,
  or click *check balance* next to its key, with the key you stored. Keys are kept in the operating
  system's credential store (Electron `safeStorage`, DPAPI on Windows) and never leave the machine
  except in the request to that provider. OpenRouter (`openrouter.ai`) passes a request on to a host
  that serves the model, and Scumble asks it to leave out every host it lists in China; for that list
  Scumble reads OpenRouter's public host list (`GET /api/v1/providers`, without the key) at the first
  OpenRouter image run or upsampling of a session. No request to OpenRouter carries an attribution
  header ([RECIPES.md, "OpenRouter"](RECIPES.md#openrouter-openrouter)). BytePlus ModelArk is reached
  at one of two regional hosts: `ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com` (Johor, Malaysia) or
  `ark.eu-west.bytepluses.com` (Dublin, Ireland). Seedream 5.0 pro always goes to Johor, and 5.0 lite
  goes to the host its *Region* row names. BytePlus may route a request to its other region. Only if
  an answer carries a download link instead of the image, Scumble fetches that link, without the key
  ([RECIPES.md, "BytePlus ModelArk"](RECIPES.md#byteplus-modelark-ark)).
- **Hugging Face**, when you click *Download* for a helper model in Settings › Helpers.
- **GitHub Releases**, for the update check (not on macOS, where the updater is off): the packaged app checks for a new version once,
  8 seconds after start, and downloads it in the background when one exists. This check can
  be switched off in Settings › Updates (*Check for updates at start*); *Check now* and
  *Restart and install* only run when you click them. The Microsoft Store copy never asks
  GitHub: the Store updates it.
- **Links you click** (Help menu, "get a key" next to a provider) open in your browser.

Scumble collects no usage data, has no telemetry and no crash reporting. Your images,
documents, autosaves and settings stay in `%APPDATA%\Scumble` on your machine (the Microsoft
Store copy keeps them in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\<its package>\LocalCache\Roaming\Scumble Store`,
which Windows removes when the app is uninstalled).
