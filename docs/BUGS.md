# Bug list

Reported and not yet fixed. One section per bug: what was seen, what is already known
about it, and what has to be measured before anyone writes code. A bug leaves this file
when it is fixed (with the release it went out in) or when it turns out not to be one.

Fixed bugs are not kept here - `CHANGELOG.md` has them per release, `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`
the ones that were performance work.

## Fixed, waiting for its release

### Erasing had become very slow since 0.1.32 - fixed for 0.1.33

**Reported** 2026-09-29 by the user: "das radieren ist seit dem letzten update mega langsam geworden", then "auf
hochauflösenden bildern sehr langsam und ruckelig", and "gefühlt am schlimmsten ist es wenn man innerhalb einer auswahl
radiert". **Cause**: package 4 step 5 (788e26e) painted every coalesced pen point as a segment of its own: its own
stroke-buffer box (on tiles a scratch round trip), both ends of the soft dab or tip stamped, and for clone and heal their
own source and destination reads; a slow frame coalesced more points into the next move. **Fix** (80bce51, 3dfaf61 on
main; `hotfix/0.1.33` off v0.1.32): `layerStroke` and `cloneStroke` draw a move in one box, `pathStamps` places its dabs
evenly along the whole path (both ends for the brushes, past the start for clone and heal, as one segment did), each
segment weighted by its own step so a pen's rising pressure does not space the large dabs as the smallest, and Follow
stroke takes the tip's angle from the move (0.1.32 took it from each coalesced piece, and pieces under 0.5 px never turned
it). Carrying the spacing across moves (the first idea here) was not built: it would have made a large soft eraser's edge
visibly softer than 0.1.31's, where one move's density per frame keeps it. A straight move of 8 coalesced points writes
the bytes of one point (soft, tip, Follow stroke at flow 100 and 50 %, paint, clone, heal; the hard brush one line per
move, only its antialiased outline moves); `editor_test` "a_move_of_coalesced_points_is_one_box_and_one_run_of_dabs",
both backends. A review workflow (four lenses, a skeptic per finding) found the two points after 80bce51.

**Measured** (`tools/brush_perf.js`, 15000 x 10000, tiles, fit, 8 coalesced points, ms a move, median; 0.1.31 / 0.1.32 /
fix): erase 700 px 14.2 / 57.1 / 13.0 and 1,000 px 21.7 / 108.8 / 18.9; paint (hard) 1,000 px 9.4 / 52.6 / 10.2; clone
1,000 px 15.8 / 112.2 / 27.7; heal 700 px 16.3 / 124.6 / 27.6. Clone and heal stay above 0.1.31 at the largest sizes with
one point a move too (23.5 and 24.9 ms): that is 0.1.32's box-per-move source, which saves 0.1.31's half second and
1.7 GB at the press. Inside a selection (`SELECT`, a hard rectangle over 5-95 %) the same rows: erase 1,000 px
18.0 / 98.0 / 16.8. The selection itself added nothing measurable per move or per frame in any version, only 10-20 ms
once at the release; not covered: a feathered or free selection, strokes across its edge, other zooms, a real pen. If
the user still finds it slow inside a selection on 0.1.33, measure that case first.

### The reference list's up / down moved a reference past the next layer, not the next reference - fixed for 0.1.34

**Found** 2026-09-29 while `docs/PLAN_REFS.md` was researched (read): up / down called `moveLayer(id, ±1)` on the
whole stack, so with an image layer between two references a click added an undo step and left the reference order as
it was. `moveReference` (step 26b1) steps past the next reference with `reorderLayer`; Ctrl+] / Ctrl+[ on an active
reference do the same. The commands gate's `refs_remap` moves one past the other.

### At the renderer's 15.5 GB of typed arrays the editor threw a RangeError - fixed for 0.1.32

**Found** by phase N1 (2026-09-17, `native_limits.py layers 15000x10000 22`: the 19th full 15k layer) and the gap review
of 2026-09-26: at Chromium's limit on `ArrayBuffer`s a new tile's `new Uint8ClampedArray` threw an uncaught
`RangeError: Array buffer allocation failed` out of whatever write needed it (`allocTileBytes`, after the arena had
counted a refused chunk). And `writable()` counted a shared tile's holders down *before* it allocated the copy, so a
failed allocation let the next write go into the tile the undo step still read. Now the copy comes first, the
allocation throws a `PixelMemoryError` whose message says what ran out and what gives it back (close a document,
delete or merge layers), a stroke's commit catches it (its undo step is in), and the shell shows one nothing caught in
the status line. `tools/pixel_memory_test.js` (plain Node; red on the old order). Mip chains built while drawing can
still hit the limit; not measured in the app.

### A user font renamed on open could lose to a local font of the same family - fixed for 0.1.32

**Found** by the .scumble review of 2026-09-26 (read): `ensureFont` (`renderer/editor/inpaint_text.js`) searched the
user font list by family before it looked at the layer's `fontRef`, so a document whose "MyFont.ttf" was imported as
"MyFont (1).ttf" (the mirror held other bytes under that name) re-rendered its text from the local file. Now the
layer's own file comes first and the family only when that file does not load; every font file is registered under a
name of its own, so two files of one family in one session each draw as themselves. `tools/font_ref_test.js` (plain
Node, the editor's host and FontFace stood in for; red on the old code).

### Rotate, distort and warp baked the layer mask in without a word - fixed for 0.1.32

**Found** by the gap review of 2026-09-26 (read): `applyPending` bakes a live mask into the new pixels and drops a
switched-off one (the new pixels have no grid the mask could stay on), and said nothing. Now the status line says
which of the two happened and that Ctrl+Z brings the mask back (the `layerfull` undo step holds it). Editor step
`a_transform_says_it_baked_the_mask`.

### The Opacity slider was hidden for the brushes, and AltGr+8 / AltGr+9 moved the layer - fixed for 0.1.32

**Found** 2026-09-27 by package 4's map of the brush code (`dist/map4/engine.md` R6 and R5, read): `buildOptsBar`
moved the Opacity label twice, and the second call (for "shape", since e0c00a7) overwrote its tool list, so the
slider showed for the shape tool only (paint, erase, clone, heal, bucket and gradient had it through `set_brush`
alone). And on a German keyboard `[` and `]` are AltGr+8 / AltGr+9, which Chromium on Windows reports with Ctrl and
Alt down: the key handler took them for Ctrl+[ / Ctrl+] and moved the active layer instead of sizing the brush (AltGr
+ß for `\`, the base peek, did nothing). Now one tool list, and `onKey` treats a key typed with AltGr as the
character it types. Editor step `brush_keys_under_altgr_and_the_opacity_slider`.

### Guides, saved selections, past results, film points and 3D objects stayed put on Crop, Extend or Resize - fixed for 0.1.32

**Found** 2026-09-26 (saved selections, the gap review) and 2026-09-27 (guides, by reading; results-history entries,
film control points, glb frames and a fixed export size by 23b's map of the code): none of them followed a crop, an
extend or a resize, so they landed off by what was cut away or added. Now one map (`docXf`, PLAN_0_1_31 §7 23b step 3)
moves them all: guides shifted or scaled and dropped outside (held by the canvas step), saved selections and history
entries through an `xf`, the plugins through the geometry event's matrix, a fixed export size zeroed. Editor step
`guides_and_saved_selections_follow_crop_extend_resize` on both backends, glb `frame_follows_crop_resize_and_turn`,
film `points_follow_crop_resize_and_turn`.

### A text layer rotated by the transform tool lost its rotation on the next edit - fixed for 0.1.32

**Found** 2026-09-27 (23a's review): the transform tool baked the turned text into pixels and kept no angle, so the
next render drew it upright. Now the text keeps `text.angle` and is drawn at it (23b step 4); distort and warp turn it
into a paint layer with a status line. Editor step `a_text_layer_keeps_its_free_angle` on both backends. A text turned
by 0.1.31 has no angle stored and still comes back upright at its first edit.

### TIFF was offered and could not be read - fixed for 0.1.30

**Found** by the gap review of 2026-09-26: the Open dialog listed `tif` / `tiff`, the file was uploaded to the mirror
(and a connected ComfyUI) and then failed in an `<img>`. Now `renderer/editor/inpaint_tiff.js` reads it as a stream
(and writes TIFF exports); a TIFF never reaches the local store. Gate `tiff` on both backends, `tools/tiff_test.js`;
mutation rounds 22 of 22 (the module) and 10 of 10 (the app side).

### Every PNG export carried the prompt, the seed and the recipe - fixed for 0.1.30

**Found** by the gap review of 2026-09-26: two tEXt chunks in every PNG export, the recipe (for an imported workflow
every widget value of it, paths and third-party key widgets included) and the prompt fields. Now only when the Export
section's switch *Prompt and recipe in the PNG* (`settings.embedRecipe`, off by default then, on since 0.1.32) or the `export` command's
`metadata` says so (`host.workflowForPng` answers null otherwise; the node keeps embedding its graph). Every PNG export
also carries an `sRGB` chunk on both paths (not the uploads, whose names are their hash). Gate `metadata`
(`tools/metadata_test.py`) on both backends, 12 of 12 mutations red.

### A quit or an update install skipped the pixel flush - fixed for 0.1.29

**Found** by the gap review of 2026-09-26. Layer pixels reach the file mirror 15 s after the last change, and neither a
close nor `quitAndInstall` waited for them: the last strokes, or a layer made in those seconds, came back without
their pixels. Now a close waits for the window's save and the update's installer starts after it
(`electron/main/quit.js`); a crashed window reloads. On the way: a send to a crashed window failed, Electron logged the
failure and the log sent it again, 1.4 MB of log over two crashes (`main.js` `send` and the log forwarding). Gate
`quit` (`tools/quit_test.py`, `tools/quit_test.js`), 11 of 11 mutations red.

### The creative upscalers seem to take no prompt - fixed for 0.1.27

**Reported** by the user on 2026-09-22 ("beim creative upscale muss man auch einen prompt mitsenden koennen").
Clarity and Magnific Creative (`usesPrompt`) did send a prompt, but only the Generate tab's, and the Upscale dialog
showed nothing of it. The dialog has a Prompt field for such a recipe now (`#up-prompt`, prefilled from the tab), the
`upscale` command a `prompt` argument, `list_recipes` a `usesPrompt` flag. Gate step
`the_dialog_sends_its_own_prompt_to_an_upscaler_that_takes_one` (`tools/upscale_test.py`), 6 of 6 mutations red.
**Not changed, and only a key could decide it:** Topaz Wonder's *Redefine* model takes a `prompt` on fal (its schema
says so), Topaz Bloom only `autoprompt`; neither recipe sends a prompt, because it is unknown whether the other Wonder
models refuse one.

### A PSD saved with layers cannot be opened with them - fixed for 0.1.25

Reported by the user on 2026-09-22 ("man kann zwar als .psd speichern aber keine .psd mit den ebenen laden").
Measured: not a broken path but a missing one. The open dialog listed no `.psd` / `.ora`, and a PSD reached the
browser's image decoder, which cannot read it. **Built:** `renderer/editor/inpaint_layered.js` (`readPsd`, `readOra`,
plain data, no DOM) and the editor's `readLayered` / `loadLayered`: `loadFile` (Open, `load_image`, a drop on an empty
tab) opens a PSD or ORA with its layers, decided by the file's first bytes, not its name; a drop on an open document
adds its layers where the file has them. The bottom layer becomes the base when it covers the picture, visible,
opaque and normal (Photoshop's Background, the editor's own export); otherwise the base is transparent. A layer mask
is multiplied into the layer's alpha, a group's visibility and opacity into its layers; adjustment and fill layers,
clipping masks and blend modes the editor lacks are named in the status line. RGB and grayscale, 8 and 16 bit, RLE,
raw and ZIP; PSB, CMYK, Lab and 32 bit are refused by name. **Found on the way and fixed:** the editor's own PSD
export wrote every layer name through an ASCII-only Pascal string, so "Gürtel" came back as "G_rtel" in Photoshop too;
both PSD writers (`inpaint_export.js`, `inpaint_bands.js`) now also write the `luni` block with the full name.
Checked on real files of the user's (Photoshop PSDs with groups, masks and a gradient fill; the editor's own PSD and
ORA exports): the layers composited again match the file's merged picture to 0.00 to 0.14 levels, except where a
left-out fill layer is the background (named in the notes). Tests: `node tools/layered_test.js` (44 checks on files
built byte by byte), the gate `layered` (`tools/layered_test.py`, 7 steps: the round trip through the editor's own
PSD and ORA export, a transparent base, a drop, a file named .png, a truncated file); mutation round 18 of 18 red.

### Layer names cannot be edited (GitHub issue #1) - fixed for 0.1.23

Measured on 2026-09-21 in a fresh instance: the side panel was 291 px, a layer row 259 px, its content 274 px, and
the name of every layer with the full button set **0 px** wide (the Base row, with fewer buttons, 202 px). The name is
the only element that gives in (`flex:1` with `overflow:hidden`), so it vanished, could not be double-clicked, and the
trash button stood 23 px past the list's edge. The rename itself (`renameLayerInline`) was never broken. Fixed: the
panel is 320 px, the row's mini buttons 22 px with a 3 px gap, the name `min-width:48px`, the kind select shrinks
(44 to 84 px), the selects of the expanded rows shrink, a text layer's rows wrap, and a rename pushes a `layers` undo
step. `editor_test.py` `layer_rows_fit_the_panel_and_names_can_be_renamed` (17 layers, so the list shows its
scrollbar; the active row of each kind; nothing past the list's edge; a real `dblclick`, Enter, undo) is red on the
0.1.22 code and red without the undo step.

An entry here leaves the file when the release named in it is published.

- **The assistant's picker warned about itself** (fixed 2026-09-20, in 0.1.22; reported by the user the same
  evening 0.1.21 went out: "wieso hast du im agent ueberall geschrieben: not tried with a real key... muessen die
  user ja nicht wissen"). `marks()` in `renderer/assistant.js` appended "not tried with a real key" to every model
  of every provider, because every registry entry carried `tried: false` - ten providers, so the picker read as a
  row of warnings about the app instead of information about a model. **Decided and done:** the mark goes
  altogether, and with it the `tried` flag of `electron/main/assistant/providers.js` and the field `picker()` and
  `noticeFor()` put on their answer. A row now says only what is true of that model ("cannot look at the picture",
  a provider's own preview note). The honest sentence stays where the report said it belongs: `docs/ASSISTANT.md`,
  "What it cannot do" ("It has **not been tried against a live API** in this release"), and the release notes.
  Gate: `tools/assistant_test.py` `the_picker_carries_the_users_own_models_and_no_warning_about_itself` (no option
  of the rendered picker matches "not tried" or "not tested"), and `node tools/models_test.js`
  `no_group_warns_about_itself` for the groups the main process hands over; both red when the mark is put back.
- **FLUX.2 [flex] on fal sent the safety tolerance as its step count** (fixed 2026-09-20, in 0.1.21; it was under
  "What OpenRouter (item 12) found on the way"). `recipes/flux2_flex.json`, the `fal` variant carried
  `num_inference_steps` and `safety_tolerance` both at `"index": 1`. One slot holds one value
  (`editor.settings["1"]`, `settingsChanged`), and `providerParams` reads every row from its slot, so the panel showed
  two rows instead of three and the request went out as `num_inference_steps: "2", guidance_scale: 2.5,
  safety_tolerance: "2"`: 2 steps instead of 50, and the steps as a string (measured in the app on the old file,
  2026-09-20). The row is `"index": 3` now, the slot `guidance_scale` does not use. Gates: `node tools/recipes_test.js`
  (every settings row of every shipped recipe owns its slot and its key, comfy recipes included) and
  `tools/recipes_test.py` `flux2_flex_on_fal_has_three_slots_and_sends_three_values` (three rows with three labels,
  three values in the request).
- **A recipe with a `providers` map could not be imported** (fixed 2026-09-20, in 0.1.21; same section). `importFile`
  (`electron/main/recipes.js`) took a provider recipe only in the old one-provider shape, so the shape every shipped
  recipe has was refused with "This file is neither a ComfyUI workflow, an API-format prompt nor a Scumble recipe."
  and nobody could copy a recipe, add a variant of their own and import it. `hasVariants` now takes either shape, a
  `kind: "provider"` file that names no provider at all gets a message of its own (an empty map and an array count as
  none), and `importFile` answers the normalized recipe, as `list()` serves it - the Settings note used to read
  "(undefined, 0 nodes, 0 settings)" for a provider recipe and now names the providers that came in. A copy that keeps
  the shipped id still shadows the shipped recipe, as one placed in `%APPDATA%/Scumble/recipes/` by hand does. Gates:
  `node tools/recipes_test.js` (both shapes, what stays refused, nothing written on a refusal) and
  `tools/recipes_test.py` (the import through the dialog, the list, the chosen variant reaching `host`).
- **Opening a large JPEG, WebP or a PNG with a colour profile blocked the window** (fixed 2026-09-19, in 0.1.20; it
  was under "What phase N1 found on the way"). On tiles such a file of `InpaintEditor.imageWorkerFrom` pixels and more
  (32 MP; 0 turns it off) is decoded in a pool worker (`image_read`: `createImageBitmap` with the `<img>`'s settings,
  drawn in bands of 256 rows into a CPU OffscreenCanvas and read there) and put into tiles without the round trip
  (`putCanvasRows`); a plain PNG keeps the stream reader. It covers opening a file, an image layer (drop, paste, the
  file inputs, `add_image_layer`), the restore at start (every file on tiles by its own size, fetched once: a small one
  goes to the `<img>` from the bytes already fetched) and `load_image` by file name (`setBaseFromRef`). A failed read
  falls back to the `<img>` (but for a PNG above the canvas limit, which only the stream reader holds); an open still
  decoding never lands over a later one; a PNG with a `cICP` chunk keeps the browser's decoder too, as `iCCP`, `gAMA`
  and `cHRM` did. The same bytes as the `<img>` way. 15000 x 10000, the window
  blocked before / after (`dist/daily/open_bench.py`): JPEG 950 / 98 ms, JPEG with an Adobe RGB profile 3,692 / 34 ms,
  JPEG with EXIF orientation 6 1,872 / 62 ms, WebP with alpha 1,656 / 38 ms, PNG with an Adobe RGB profile 4,437 /
  45 ms; wall 1.04 to 0.78 s, 3.78 to 1.08 s, 5.84 to 2.68 s. Gate: `editor_test.py`
  `large_image_files_open_in_a_worker` (six Pillow files: plain, profiled and rotated JPEG, alpha WebP, profiled and
  16-bit PNG; the worker's bytes against the `<img>`'s, the EXIF size, the profile really applied, an image layer and
  a restore through the worker). Mutations caught: the profile dropped, `premultiplyAlpha: "none"`, a band a row off,
  the restore not routed, `imageOrientation: "flipY"`; `"none"` is equivalent (Chromium 152 treats it as
  `"from-image"`). Canvas backend unchanged.
- **A provider run's crop and stitch held the window** (fixed 2026-09-19, in 0.1.20). The row in the list said
  0.6 s; on the user's usual document it was far worse, because `readBox` took the whole flatten for a colour-matched
  layer: 15000 x 10000, a 1,024 px selection (`native_test.py provider_crop`, `match_provider_crop`,
  `film_provider_crop`), the longest block before / after: plain stack 665 / 24 ms, with a 5,000 x 3,500 matched
  layer 1,469 / 22 ms, with a film look over it 6,283 / 51 ms; wall about 0.6 s, in workers. `host.runProvider` now
  calls `prepareCropAsync` / `finishResultAsync` (stitch.js): the selection's window is read here and planned, the
  crop box is composited by the tile workers (`readBoxBytes`: the stack or the filter program of B items 1 and 7, the
  matched layer's statistics from point samples as decision (b) of 7c allows for runs; `readBox` and the canvas
  backend's flatten are the fallback), and the crop, the masks, the resizes, the answer's decode, the colour match and
  every PNG are made in a stitch worker of its own (`stitch_worker.js`, app only), the same steps as the synchronous
  pair (`planCrop`, `cropPixels`, `finishPixels`). The run is one moment as before: the selection's window, the stack
  the box is composited from (`holdRunStack`, copy-on-write clones), the reference layers, the recipe's parameters, the
  prompt and the seed are all taken at the click, before the first await. The synchronous `prepareCrop` / `finishResult` stay (the fallback
  and what the size tests read); `setStitchInWorker(false)` and `InpaintEditor.boxOverTiles = false` are the A/B
  switches. Gate: `export_test.py` `a_run_off_the_window_sends_what_the_window_sent`: info, masks and the plain
  stack's crop and patch files byte for byte against the synchronous pair; over a soft layer and a levels layer within
  B item 1's two levels on 0.1 % of the bytes, with a matched layer within decision (b)'s levels (colour premultiplied
  by alpha: a level where alpha is 8 is 31 levels of straight colour nobody sees). Mutations caught: the box a row
  off, the stitch without its region, the mask not resized, a program band shifted; the limits dropped in the shared
  settings is equivalent there (`size_test` holds it). `smoke` ran the new path against the loopback provider
  (2026-09-19, PASS on both backends). An adversarial review (four lenses, two refuters a finding: 15 findings, 7
  upheld, all fixed with the other 8) gave the one-moment snapshot, the parameters at the click, the `<img>` fallback of
  the stream reader, `cICP`, the restore by file size and the transfers instead of copies.
- **Releasing a stroke held the window** (fixed on tiles 2026-09-19, in 0.1.20; the bullet "Releasing an erase stroke
  is its own stutter" below). The commit wrote band after band through canvases (the stroke's part materialised, the
  layer's tiles put into a scratch, drawn, read back): on tiles a stroke is now composited a tile at a time through
  the compositing kernel (`commitStrokeTiles`, `compositeStroke`: the stroke's box and, with a clip, the selection
  under each tile as the kernel's coverage; only the pixels the stroke reaches are written). A scaled or fractional
  layer with a clip and the canvas backend keep the bands; `InpaintEditor.strokeTiles = false` is the A/B switch.
  `tools/release_test.py` (real mouse events, 15000 x 10000 with a matched result layer and a film look, until the
  picture settled), the longest block after the release before / after: an erase on the matched layer at fit 70 /
  34 ms (the commit 51 / 17), a stroke of paint there 88 / 36 ms (67 / 19), a long diagonal erase across a full-size
  layer 288 / 66 ms (271 / 48); at 1:1 31 / 38 ms (the commit 4 ms either way, the frame's film look the rest). Gate:
  `editor_test.py` `a_stroke_commits_through_the_kernel_on_tiles` (paint at an opacity, erase, erase at an opacity,
  the alpha locked, paint and erase clipped on a layer off the origin: pixels the stroke does not reach the same bytes,
  the rest within two levels premultiplied of the bands', undo byte for byte; an erase at full opacity is the same
  bytes). Mutations caught: the clip ignored, the opacity ignored, the alpha lock as source-over, untouched pixels
  not restored, the clip a few pixels off, the clip without the layer's offset.

### Switching between the local recipes keeps the other recipe's model files (found by the 26e review, 2026-09-29)

**Found** by the review of item 26 step 26e (read, and reproduced in a plain-Node copy of the three functions; not run in
the app, not queued): Qwen Image Edit 2.1 and FLUX.2 Klein (both local) name their loaders `unet`, `clip` and `vae`
(settings rows 1-3). `host.settingTargets`' local branch sets the target's `node.id` to the bare node name, and
`settingsChanged` (`inpaint_canvas.js`) keeps a stored value while `${node.id}:${inputName}` stays the same, so after Qwen
then Klein the Klein chain is queued with `unet_name = qwen_image_2.1_int8_convrot.safetensors`, Qwen's text encoder
(with `CLIPLoader` type `flux2`) and Qwen's VAE; the other way round too. The combo fallback only changes a value missing
from the server's list, and both families' files can be installed. Older than 26e (the rows are the same before it). The
provider branch of `settingTargets` already has the fix for the same collision (the recipe id in the node id). Fix: a
target key with the recipe id (`${r.id}/${node}:${input}`) for the local rows, compared and stored by `settingsChanged`
(the node's editor has no such key and keeps its behaviour); a document saved before the fix then resets these rows once
to the recipe's defaults. Test: the recipes gate's 26e step queues Qwen then Klein; assert Klein's own `unet_name`,
`clip_name`, `vae_name`, and the reverse.

### Generate new on Gemini direct ignores the asked aspect while the Aspect row says "auto" (found by the 26f adapter review, 2026-09-29, read)

**Found** by the adapter review of item 26 step 26f (read, not run live): `gemini.js` sets `imageConfig.aspectRatio =
req.aspect` on a text run only when the params hold no `aspect_ratio`, and the variants' Aspect row defaults to "auto",
which the later line skips; so a Generate new without reference layers sends no aspect at all and the model answers in its
own shape, whatever the dialog asked (16:9 comes back square). With reference layers 26f already sends the asked aspect
(or the closest of Gemini's ratios for a free size). Fix: treat "auto" like no row on a text run (`!p.aspect_ratio ||
p.aspect_ratio === "auto"`); it changes the 0-reference request, so `tools/refs_layout_test.js`'s byte-for-byte check of
Gemini's text body moves with it. The Router's vertexai dialect had the same gap with references and was fixed in 26f.

### Smudge and the tone brushes still dab once per coalesced point (measured 2026-09-29, not a regression)

**Found** by the review of the eraser fix (0.1.33): `smudgeDab` (smudge, blur, sharpen, dodge / burn, sponge) is still
called once per coalesced point (`onPointerMove`, `finishStroke`), each at least one dab with its own read and write of
the layer box. Measured with `brush_perf.js` at 15000 x 10000: smudge 700 px 73.8 ms a move with 8 coalesced points against
27.8 with one (200 px: 7.0 against 8.4). Not a regression: 0.1.31's smudge took 0.6 to 2.3 s a move, and the tone brushes
are new in 0.1.32. The same treatment as `layerStroke` would fix it (the move's points in one walk, dabs evenly along the
path past the start, one `touchSourceRect` over the move's box), but the smudge's look depends on its dab count (the
carry is laid down and picked up per dab), so a pen's smudge would change: the user's eye first.

### Found by reading on 2026-09-26 (not yet measured)

**Written** 2026-09-26 by a gap review of the whole app (read, not run). Each has to be measured before it is fixed.
The ones that were part of `docs/PLAN_0_1_29.md` §3 (the skipped flush on quit, TIFF, the PNG metadata) are fixed:
"Fixed, waiting for its release".

- **The film look "None (adjustments only)" still adds grain**: `plugins/film/filters.js` ~387 falls back to
  `{ amount: 25, ... }` when there is no stock.

### Found in the .scumble review (2026-09-26, read, not run)

**Written** 2026-09-26 when `docs/DOCUMENTS.md` was written from the code (package 3b). The other findings of that
review are fixed (reserved Windows names, refs the document does not carry, `extra` in the ref walkers and the renames,
the temp registry after the rename, `summary.name`); these touch the shared editor code and wait (the user font renamed
on open is fixed for 0.1.32, above):

- **A layer of an unknown kind without a `ref` is dropped on open without a note** (`inpaint_canvas.js` `setValue`,
  `if (!l.ref) continue;`); the plan wanted a note. Only a document from a newer Scumble can hold one.
- **Canvas backend only: an undo back to the saved state leaves the tab's "*"** (measured by `docux`, 2026-09-26). The
  layer's upload name is a hash of its PNG, encoded through `createImageBitmap` of a GPU canvas; fully transparent
  pixels can come back with other colour bytes, so the same visible pixels (0 differ) get another name and the state
  another hash. Tiles (the default) is exact. A fix would hash the pixels with transparent colour zeroed, or zero it
  before the encode.

### Reference layers dropped without a word (found for item 26, 2026-09-29, read, not run)

**Written** 2026-09-29 while `docs/PLAN_REFS.md` was researched (code and vendor docs read, nothing run). A visible
reference layer can fail to reach the model without any message. Steps 26a2 and 26e of that plan fix these. The Klein
item could also be fixed on its own. **Step 26a2 (2026-09-29, plain-Node tests, not run live)** fixed the provider
items: every route now sends every picture, refuses before any request past its cap, or declares the drop, and then
sends no reference at all and says so in the status line (`docs/RECIPES.md` "Reference pictures"). The local, Info
panel and node items stay for step 26e. **Step 26e (2026-09-29, not run on ComfyUI)** fixed the local and Info panel
items (`docs/RECIPES.md` "Reference images named in the prompt (local)"); the node item waits for a node release.

- **`flux2_klein_local` reads only batch pictures 0 and 1**, the crop and the next one. With Original on, no reference
  layer reaches the model. With Original off, only ref 1 does, and ref 2+ are dropped. The recipe's description names
  only the Original case. `qwen_image_edit_2_1_local` reads 3 pictures, and `ImageFromBatch` clamps, so with fewer
  pictures the last one is repeated into the empty slots. **Fixed in 26e (2026-09-29):** Klein reads up to 4 pictures
  (the crop and three more as reference latents at 1 MP each), Qwen 2.1 up to 10; the encoder inputs past the batch a
  run sends are left out of the queued prompt, so nothing repeats (the same seed now gives another result). A
  reference past the recipe's slots is refused when the prompt names it and otherwise left out with "img3 is not
  sent" in the status line. Neither widened graph has run.
- **BFL keeps 7 references** (`bfl.js:23`, `slice(0, 7)`) and drops the rest silently. FLUX.2 klein on BFL takes only
  4 pictures in total, and nothing enforces that. **Fixed in 26a2 (2026-09-29):** every reference goes
  (`input_image_2` ..), the layout's `max` is 4 for klein and 8 for FLUX.2 pro / flex / max, and a run past it is
  refused before any request (the builder checks too, for a direct call).
- **Comfy Cloud cuts Qwen after 3 pictures** (`comfycloud.js:105`). `GeminiImage2Node`, `GeminiImageNode` and
  `FluxProFillNode` upload the references but never wire them; so do the four upscaler nodes when a recipe runs them
  as an edit, and an OpenAI node edit without `options.mask` uploads the mask and wires nothing (step 26a1's layout
  pin, 2026-09-29: every reference gets a LoadImage node, linked or not). **Fixed in 26a2 (2026-09-29):** a cap per
  node (`NODE_PICTURES`: Qwen 3, FLUX.2 8, GPT Image 16, Nano Banana 2 14, Seedream 10 / lite 14) refuses past it
  before any upload; the one-picture nodes and FLUX.1 Fill declare the drop; `buildGraph` uploads only the references
  and the mask the node wires. The `nano_banana_pro` Comfy Cloud note no longer contradicts itself or advises Original on.
- **Fill routes without an images field drop references**: flux1_fill on BFL / fal / Replicate / WaveSpeed, Qwen
  inpaint on fal, Z-Image turbo, Ideogram 4 on fal, and Replicate's Qwen Image Edit (`replicate.js:47-52`, crop only,
  although its note says "crop plus the reference layers"). **Fixed in 26a2 (2026-09-29):** each declares the drop,
  so no reference and no Original goes and the status line says what was not sent; Replicate's Qwen Image Edit note
  says the endpoint takes one picture.
- **FLUX.2 klein on Oxen has no `max_images`** and falls back to Oxen's default of 16. **Moved on in 26a2
  (2026-09-29):** Oxen's hub schema names no maximum either, so no cap was set; the variant is on the undocumented
  list in `docs/RECIPES.md` (BFL's own klein takes 4), until a live key shows what Oxen does past 4.
- **fal's caps are not checked**: Seedream edit on fal is said to keep the *last* pictures past its cap, which would
  drop the crop. Re-read the v5 lite / pro edit pages before relying on this. `flux-2/klein/9b/edit` uses only the first 4.
  **Fixed in 26a2 (2026-09-29):** fal's layout reads `options.max_images` and a run past it is refused before any
  request: Seedream 5 lite / pro 10, klein 4, FLUX.2 pro / flex / max 8, GPT Image 2 16, Grok Imagine 5 (sources in
  `docs/RECIPES.md`); fal's Nano Banana 2 and Pro name no number and are on the undocumented list.
- **flux1_fill on Comfy Router refuses any run with a visible reference** (`comfyrouter.js:205-209`, `max_images`
  defaults to 1), although its note says "The reference layers are not sent." `picturesFor` counts the references
  before the fill body drops them; step 26a1's layout declares the drop and `max` 1, and its pin expects the refusal.
  **Fixed in 26a2 (2026-09-29):** the declared drop strips the references before the adapter, so the run goes out
  with the crop and the mask and the status line says what was not sent; the recipe's note says so too.
- **A WaveSpeed fill whose variant sets `fields.images` sends no mask**: `inputFor` takes the image-list branch for
  it and never adds `mask_image` (found by step 26a1's layout check, 2026-09-29). No shipped variant does this.
  Still open after 26a2 (not a reference drop; the layout describes it as it is sent).
- **The Info panel's batch count ignores the refine pass**, which leaves the Original out (`inpaint_canvas.js:13225`).
  **Fixed in 26e (2026-09-29):** the count leaves the Original out on a refine pass in local mode (the node's copy
  with its next build), and on a local recipe of the app counts only the references the graph reads; the References
  row names each one (`img1 → <image3>`) and what is not sent.
- **The node skips a reference it cannot load** (`nodes.py` about 682, "reference skipped"), with only a print, and
  every later reference moves up one place. Still open after 26e, where it would make a local run's names point one
  picture off. Since 26e the app sends `named_refs: true` in `canvas_state` when the prompt named a reference; the
  next node release should raise instead of print at `nodes.py:684-685` when it is set.
- (The reference list's up / down: fixed by step 26b1, above under "Fixed".)

### Found while planning item 26 (2026-09-29, read, not run)

**Written** 2026-09-29 by the step planners of `docs/PLAN_REFS.md` (code read, nothing run). Each is fixed by the step
named.

- ~~**Replicate text runs send `aspect_ratio: "match_input_image"`**: `providerParams` includes `r.fixed`, and the
  params loop in `replicate.js` (about 42-60) overwrites the aspect the user asked for, so every Replicate FLUX.2, Nano
  Banana and Seedream Generate new sends it. Step 26f.~~ **Fixed in 26f (2026-09-29):** `replicate.js` holds a text run
  to its shape after the settings: the asked aspect wins, and without one (a free size, an agent's width and height) a
  fixed `match_input_image` becomes the preset closest to the asked size (1:1, 3:2, 2:3, 4:3, 3:4, 16:9, 9:16); a
  model that names no `aspect_ratio` (GPT Image 2) keeps its own default as before. Checked with a fake fetch against
  every shipped Replicate text shape (only the aspect changed); not run live.
- ~~**`llm.ask` never reads a language model row's `vision: false`**~~ **Fixed in 26d2 (2026-09-29):** a user row
  marked "Can see the picture: no" gets no picture at all, the crop included (the local endpoint's model too, looked up
  in every row of Settings › Language models); a built-in model id keeps winning over a user row of the same id, as
  everywhere. `tools/llm_images_test.js`.
- ~~**The local OpenAI-compatible endpoint retries any 4xx without the picture**~~ **Fixed in 26d2 (2026-09-29):** it
  steps down only on a 400 / 413 / 415 / 422 or a failure whose own text (the model id taken out) names images; a 401 /
  402 / 429, a 403 / 404 that names no image, or a server that cannot be reached costs one request.
  `tools/llm_images_test.js`.

### macOS: built and run, with gaps (B3, 2026-09-30)

**Written** 2026-09-30 with the macOS build (`docs/PLAN_MACOS.md`). Built and run on one Apple Silicon Mac (macOS 26.2);
the gates that need no ComfyUI and no key ran on both backends. What that machine could not show:

- **macOS: Intel Macs.** There is no x64 build: the ONNX runtime's binary in the package is `darwin/arm64`, so an
  Intel build would have no helper models. The `mac` block of `package.json` lists arm64 only.
- **macOS: the CoreML provider's speed.** The helper models (SAM2, background removal) start, but no one has
  measured whether ONNX Runtime's CoreML provider is used or how fast it is against the CPU fallback.
- **macOS: Retina displays.** The darwin composite references (`tools/refs/composite_*.darwin.png`) were made on a
  1600x1000 display at 1x and are tied to a canvas 1222 px wide; on another display or scale the `composite` gate
  compares against the wrong picture. Nothing has looked at the tile atlas at 2x.
- **macOS: the manual still says Ctrl.** The app's labels read Cmd there (`renderer/editor/platform.js`), but
  `docs/MANUAL.md`, which ships inside the app, was not reworded.
- **macOS: real input was not used.** Keys, clicks and drags were dispatched through the DevTools protocol; a locked
  screen kept real keyboard and mouse input out of reach. Cmd+click, Cmd+drag and the Cmd shortcuts have not been tried
  by hand.
- **macOS: opening a file into an instance started by MCP.** The `open-file` handler is registered in that process
  too, but the case was not exercised.
- **macOS: the updater is off** (`manual`), by decision: no release carries `latest-mac.yml` yet. Not a bug; listed so
  it is not mistaken for one.

### Linux: built, never run (B2, 2026-09-22)

**Written** 2026-09-22 with the Linux job of `.github/workflows/build.yml` (AppImage and .deb, `latest-linux.yml`).
This machine has no WSL and no Docker, so the Linux build has been **built by CI and run nowhere**: no gate, no
start, no helper, no update. What is known to need a look on a real Linux desktop:

- **Gates:** they are Python + CDP and `tools/run_gates.sh` is bash, so they should run; `--exe` takes the AppImage
  (`mcp_test.py` and `assistant_test.py` take `--exe` too). Not one has run.
- **The MCP registration** of an AppImage is `"$APPIMAGE" --mcp`, **without** the Node-mode launcher (a path inside
  the AppImage changes with every start). That assumes Electron writes nothing to stdout on Linux before our code
  runs (the stray CR LF the launcher exists for is Windows' console code). Unmeasured; `mcp_test.py --exe
  <AppImage> --direct` is the check. A .deb install keeps the launcher (its paths are stable).
- **The sandbox:** on Ubuntu 23.10+ AppArmor's user-namespace limit can keep an AppImage's Electron from starting
  (the README says so). No `--no-sandbox` is added by the app.
- **Keys:** `safeStorage` on a desktop without a keyring falls back to `basic_text`; *Settings › API providers*
  warns then (`keysNote` in `renderer/shell.js`, gate `platform`). Whether `isEncryptionAvailable()` answers true
  or false in that case decides which of the two warnings the user sees; both are covered, neither observed.
- **Helpers:** CPU only (no CUDA provider in the build, `docs/HELPERS.md`); the first session logs a failed `cuda`
  attempt before it falls back.
- **The single-instance lock and the named pipe** become a unix socket (`local.js`); never exercised.


**Written** 2026-09-19 while planning the in-app assistant (`docs/PLAN_ASSISTANT.md`). Found by reading
the code and checked line by line, not reported and not run; none is fixed. The user decided on 2026-09-19
that the assistant changes nothing external agents see ("nein, soll primär für externe agenten sein, in app
agent ist nur add on"), so the assistant's plan does not fix them; each is its own item when the user says so.

- **`flip_layer` axis x flips vertically.** The command passes `"x"` / `"y"` (`renderer/commands.js:652`),
  `flipLayer` mirrors horizontally only for `"h"` and vertically for anything else
  (`renderer/editor/inpaint_canvas.js:3496`, `:3502`), so both axes flip vertically, against the command's
  own description ("horizontally (axis x)"). The toolbar buttons pass `"h"` / `"v"` (`:2193-2194`) and work.
  The fix is one line in `commands.js` (outside the node build); external agents that compensated would get
  the other flip.
- **`remove_layer` reports success on a locked layer.** `removeLayer` only sets the status line for a locked
  layer and returns (`inpaint_canvas.js:9479`); the command returns `{removed: id}` regardless
  (`commands.js:636`). The built-in plugins call the same command (ailabel's Add / Remove label,
  `plugins/ailabel/main.js:101`, `:111`; glb's Edit dropping a depth layer, `plugins/glb/main.js:117`).
  `flip_layer` and `center_layer` are silent no-ops on locked or filter layers in the same way.
- **The compat key goes to any URL `llm:models` is given.** `compatModels(url)` sends `keys.get("compat")`
  as a Bearer token to whatever base it is called with (`electron/main/llm.js:73-78`, IPC `llm:models` at
  `electron/main/main.js:459`); the renderer, a plugin included, can call it with any URL. The key is meant
  for the saved `settings.llm.compat.url` only.
- **The MCP annotations are incomplete.** `READ_ONLY` (`electron/main/mcp/server.js:31`) is tested against
  dotted command names and misses `read_log`, `film.looks`, `glb.info`, `ailabel.info` and
  `sample.mean_color`; its `describe` alternative matches no command. `destructiveHint` (`:63`) misses
  `generate_new`, `flatten`, `merge_down`, `extend_canvas`, `export*` (silent overwrite), `undo`, `redo`,
  `select_recipe`, `set_node_params` and `ailabel.add`, and marks `new_document`, which destroys nothing.
  External MCP clients that gate on these hints get the wrong picture.
- **Ctrl+Enter starts a second provider run while one is running.** `generate()` disables the button for the
  length of `host.queueGenerate` (`inpaint_canvas.js:12043`, `:12054`), but the shortcut calls `generate()`
  directly (`:2788`) and nothing checks `providerPending`; `runProvider` then replaces the token
  (`renderer/editor/host.js:858`). **Not known:** whether the first run's result still lands, and whether a
  second run is ever wanted (local runs queue on ComfyUI on purpose). An editor change, so it ships to the
  node.

### What phase N1 found on the way

**Written** 2026-09-17 with the measurement of phase N (`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §14, `tools/native_test.py`,
`tools/native_limits.py`). Seen while measuring, not reports; none is fixed.

- **The whole-picture wand on a document above the canvas limit works for 4.6 s and then refuses** ("larger than any
  canvas", 30000 × 20000, `native_test.py 30000x20000 wand_whole_picture`). Why it gets
  that far before it refuses is not read yet. Either it says so at once, or it floods over tiles.
- (The renderer's 15.5 GB of typed arrays: fixed for 0.1.32, "Fixed, waiting for its release" above.)
- (The provider crop's block and the opening of a large JPEG, WebP or profiled PNG are fixed: "Fixed, waiting for its
  release" above.)

### What phase E left open on large documents

**Written** 2026-09-17 with phase E (`docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §3, the "as built" blocks). Not reports: gates of the plan that were
measured and not met, and what still needs a canvas of the picture. Each has a number to beat.

- **(Since B item 7, 2026-09-18, only for a document with a colour-matched layer above a filter layer, a scaled or
  fractional layer, or a filter mask that is not tiles: a plain stack, blend modes, filter layers and colour-matched
  layers (part 3, the statistics from point samples of the tiles) are composited by the workers, the
  filters run over their bytes, and the case below saves in 1.4 s with a block of 0.17 s, with the film look 5.0 s
  against 9.1 s; `docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §3b "B item 7, part 2 as built". The block is still above the plan's 50 ms.)**
  An export in bands is slower in wall
  time than the whole flatten was, while the window stays usable. 15000 × 10000,
  three full paint layers and a levels layer: 6.2 s in bands (longest block 0.7 s, the first band) against 3.4 s through
  one canvas (2.4 s blocked in one piece). With the film look on top 9.5 s against 8.2 s. The time is the region pass at
  full resolution: about 130 ms a band, most of it `putImageData` of every layer's tiles into a region canvas
  (`tools/export_test.py --perf 15000x10000`). The plan's gate was 3 s and 50 ms. The way down is the one the plan had:
  composite plain stacks in the pool's workers from the arena (`composite_tile`), and keep the region pass for bands
  with a filter, a colour match or a blend mode.
- **The film look's halation on a document above the canvas limit is very slow to export**: 67 s for 20000 × 14000 with
  blocks of 7.6 s a band, 146 s with blocks of 16 s at 30000 × 20000. Its blur is 1.2 % of the long side (240 px there), so a band carries 725 rows of margin on
  either side and the pass is 60 MP, above what the WebGL filters render in one piece.
- **Inverting the selection of a very large document blocks the window**: 0.5 s, and 1.2 s back, at 30000 × 20000, and
  the inverted mask is 2.4 GB of tiles (masks are RGBA tiles; one-channel masks were C5's plan and are not built).
- **The mip refresh after a whole change still blocks 45 to 90 ms** at 15k (the gate was 5 ms): the frame the landings
  cause builds the atlas slots on the main thread (`docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §3 "E1 as built").
- **Above 268 MP only the full-size PNG, PSD and ORA are written.** JPEG, WebP, the Size row and the frame need one canvas
  and are refused with a message; so are the canvas-sized edits (resize, extend, crop to selection, merge into the base
  through a canvas) wherever they still build a canvas of the picture. A PSD stops at 30,000 px a side and 4 GB a section
  (a 30000 × 20000 document with one paint layer was 3.7 GB), an ORA at 4 GB (no zip64).
- **A colour-matched layer above a filter layer keeps the whole flatten for exports up to 268 MP**, and so does a
  provider run's crop (`readBox`) and the flatten into the base of a plain matched stack. Since B item 7 part 3
  (2026-09-18, decision (b) of C6 (c) 7c made) every other matched document takes the worker path, its statistics
  point samples of the tiles. Above 268 MP the bands use the statistics the screen uses, the only ones there are.
  So do the JPEG and WebP exports (`host.exportCanvas`). The screen keeps 7c's box means: on a textured matched
  layer a PNG differs from a JPEG of the same document, and the wand's edge from what the screen shows, by the few
  levels the two statistics are apart (`docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §3b "B item 7, part 3 as built", the photo table).
- **Seen once, not reproduced**: `editor_test.py` `a_settled_read_builds_its_levels_in_the_worker_not_here` failed with
  `requested: 0` in one of some twenty runs since the mip chains go through the pool.

### A local run on a large document spends minutes in the node's stitch

**Found** 2026-09-19 by the first `smoke` against a real server since phase E: a local Flux.2 Klein run on a 6000 x
4000 document (a soft paint layer, a matched result layer, a levels layer; a 1000 x 800 selection) took 19 min 27 s,
of which 15 min were the node's stitch after the VAE decode, one CPU core busy, the GPU idle. The app's side was
right: the base went up in bands through the filter program (`n2_base_4682dc8486bc.png`, the hash of the composite
recomputed afterwards, the same 27,198,764 bytes) and the result landed at the crop box.

**Why:** ComfyUI-InpaintCanvas `nodes.py` builds the stitch's masks over the **whole picture** (`_composite_mask` on
the full-size selection) and dilates with a square `max_pool2d` of k = 2 x grow + 1 (137 for a 1000 x 800 selection),
k squared comparisons a pixel on the CPU: 35 s a megapixel at k = 137 (the ComfyUI's torch, one thread), so about 14
min at 24 MP and 90 min at 15000 x 10000. The run's own crop (`_denoise_mask` on the crop) costs about a minute the same
way (the 55 s between "got prompt" and the model load).

**The fix is committed and pushed in the node repo, not live yet** (`fba1fd8` on master of ComfyUI-InpaintCanvas, on
the user's word of 2026-09-19; the node folder is the user's live ComfyUI and its Python only loads after a restart): `_dilate_mask` as two separable `max_pool2d` passes (the same values: a square max is the max of the row
maxima), and the stitch's masks on a window around the region with the margin the app's `finishResult` uses. The
patch and its tests are in the session's scratchpad (`node_fix_patch.py`, `node_mask_test.py`,
`node_stitch_e2e.py`): the node's own `InpaintCanvasStitch.stitch`, today's `nodes.py` against the patched copy with
ComfyUI stubbed out, gives the same returned image and the same patch PNG, byte for byte, with auto feather, colour
match and alignment (71.5 s to 1.96 s at 2500 x 1800), with `paste` "crop" (43.1 to 0.61 s) and a plain feather; the
masks alone at 6000 x 4000 889.5 s to 4.4 s, equal on eight cases; run again against the committed file, the same.
**Next:** a ComfyUI restart when it suits the user, then one local run on a large document; the entry leaves this file
when that run is fast (a node release with a `pyproject.toml` version takes it to the registry).

### A headless MCP instance keeps Scumble from starting

**Reported** 2026-09-16 ("wieso kann ich die app nicht starten?"), during a Claude Code session in `F:\canvas`.

**Seen:** starting Scumble showed no window at all. Two processes were running, both started by that session's MCP
registration (`.mcp.json`: `electron.exe electron/main/mcp/launch.js --mcp`, i.e. the dev app from `F:\canvas`):
the launcher and `electron.exe F:\canvas --mcp`. No Scumble was running when the session began, so the MCP server had
started the app **headless** (`AgentBackend` in `electron/main/main.js`), on the default profile `%APPDATA%\Scumble`.
It held that profile's single-instance lock since the start of the session. After both were stopped, the packaged app
started normally.

**Known:** both instances use the same `userData`, so a second start is meant to hand over to the running one:
`app.on("second-instance", () => showWindow())` (`main.js` 573 for the headless agent path, 626 for the normal start),
and `showWindow()` creates the window or restores a hidden one. `docs/MCP.md` and CLAUDE.md say "a second start of
Scumble shows it". Here nothing appeared.

**Not known, to measure first:**
- Which binary the user started (the installed 0.1.14 in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`, or `dist\win-unpacked\Scumble.exe`),
  and whether a second start of the **same** build as the headless one shows the window (dev headless + dev start,
  exe headless + exe start). A dev and a packaged Electron may not share the lock or the hand-over.
- Whether `second-instance` fires in the headless instance at all (log it), and whether `showWindow()` then creates a
  window that stays hidden or off screen.
- Whether the headless instance's renderer was ready (`bridge` ready) when the second start arrived.

**Workaround:** start Scumble before Claude Code, so the MCP server drives the visible window; or stop the leftover
`electron.exe ... --mcp` processes. A fix belongs in the hand-over (the running headless instance shows its window on a
second start of any build), with a gate step in `tools/mcp_test.py`: start headless through the launcher, start the
app a second time, assert a visible window within a few seconds.

### Selection undo and bounds lose isolated pixels above 1 MP (canvas backend)

**Found** 2026-09-14 by C2's final review (`docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §C2), present since phase A (0.1.10):
on the canvas backend, which is what the packaged app ran until 0.1.13 and still runs with Settings ›
Rendering › Tile engine switched off, a selection above 1 MP takes its extent
from the selection's 1/16 display level (`selectionExtent()` in `inpaint_canvas.js`). Four smoothed
halvings round an isolated pixel away (below about alpha 128 always, and at sizes that do not halve
evenly even alpha 255), so the selection's undo step does not copy it and its bounds scan does not
look for it. Measured: 2401 × 1601, a 400 × 300 rectangle plus 24 isolated pixels of alpha 120 or
255: the extent [270, 270, 2307, 1523] misses the opaque one at (1447, 1525), `getBounds()` comes back
as [300, 300, 2280, 1491] against the exact [300, 300, 2280, 1526] (a run's crop and the ants box leave
selected pixels out), and a `select_rect` elsewhere followed by an undo restores the selection without
that pixel. 3000 × 2000 loses two alpha-120
pixels the same way; 2048 × 1536 nothing. A wand's or a matte's speckle is where it shows.

**Not fixed, on purpose**: an extent that cannot drop a pixel needs a full-resolution readback of the
selection on this backend (seconds at 15k, the cost phase A took out), or a max-pooling level the 2D
canvas cannot build. The selection drag, which lost the same pixels, takes the whole image instead
since C2 (b)'s review. On tiles the extent is the tile set's exact bounds and nothing is lost; C5 makes
the selection mask tiles and C7 retires the canvas backend, which closes this.

### A very large PNG stays jerky to work on

**Reported** 2026-09-11 by DenRakEiw, on a PNG about 15,000 px on its long side. Panning
and painting stutter badly.

**The file format is ruled out.** The user saved the same picture as JPEG and it is not
smoother (2026-09-11), which is what the pipeline predicts: after decoding, base and layers
are RGBA canvases and the format cannot matter. So the heading is misleading and the bug is
about the *size*. It is the untiled full-resolution layers that are the suspect.

**Update 2026-09-15, for 0.1.13: the tile engine is on by default.** Most of what follows describes
the state before it (untiled layers, "layer tiles were deliberately not built"); it stays as the
record. Layers, masks and the selection are tiles now (`docs/PLAN_BCE.md` C2 to C6), and 0.1.13 runs
them in the installed app unless *Settings › Rendering › Tile engine* is unticked (or `--no-tiles`).
Measured on a 15000 × 10000 document with three full-size paint layers, a colour-matched result, a
film look and a levels layer (`mem_test.py`, one document open; `PLAN_BCE.md` §C7 "The default, as
built"): about 4.5 GB in the renderer and 1.6-2.3 GB in the GPU process on tiles, against 0.7 GB and
7.2-7.8 GB with the tile engine off. The entry stays open until the user reports on their own 15k
file. What to ask for: the file's size and layer count, whether panning and painting still stutter
with the tile engine on, the same with it off (after *Restart now*), and the card's and the GPU
process's numbers from Settings › Rendering while it stutters. What is known to be still slow on
tiles is the "Still slow" list under 0.1.13 in `CHANGELOG.md` (smudge, the whole-picture wand,
invert, the whole flatten behind renders and exports); with two 15k documents open at once a levels
tick took 49-58 ms on tiles and with three the pan took 65 ms, not broken down yet.

**Update 2026-09-16, after C4, C6 (c) 7b to 7d and C6 (d) (0.1.16, unreleased).** The numbers on the synthetic 15k
document are in `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §11: pan 2.6 ms (0.2 ms on the GPU stack), a brush dab and its frame 1.2 ms, undo of a
stroke 26 ms, the first frame at 1:1 1.2 ms; a colour-matched full-size layer no longer makes 1.1 GB of copies, and a crop,
flatten or undo of them no longer decodes the picture again. Still whole-picture and slow: invert (0.9 s), the band wand
(1.8 s), a film point under a film look (2.2 s), renders and exports. The entry stays open until the user reports on
their own 15k file (what to ask for: the 2026-09-15 update above).

**What is already known**

- The GPU compositor still applies at that size: it refuses only above `MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE`,
  which is 16,384 on this machine (`inpaint_compositor.js`, the `w > this.maxTexture` guard),
  and 15,000 is under it. So this is not the documented fall-back to Canvas 2D.
- **Layer tiles were deliberately not built** (`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §"what is left"). Every
  source canvas is one texture and one full-resolution pyramid level, so a 15,000 × 10,000
  document holds about 600 MB per layer in the GPU process before anything is drawn. The
  memory watch (`settings.memory.gpuLimitMB`, default 3072) then releases caches on a timer,
  which is itself visible as a stutter.
- Phase 6 measured that four 96 MP documents open at once really are 19 GB of live pixels
  and about 40 ms a frame. 150 MP in one document is the same territory.
- **Every discrete step snapshots the whole document.** `clearSelection()`, and every
  selection change, calls `pushUndo({ kind: "selection" })`, which copies the selection
  canvas: 150 million pixels per step. Phase 1 made *brush* undo a copy of the touched
  rectangle only, but the selection steps were not part of that. On a document this size
  that alone can be the stutter.
- **Releasing an erase stroke is its own stutter** (fixed on tiles 2026-09-19: "Fixed, waiting for its release"
  above; the text below is the record) (reported separately in the same session:
  the stroke itself follows, the hitch comes on mouse up). The `layerpaint` pointer-up runs
  `strokeRect`, `commitStroke` and `markLayerChanged(layer, box)`, which refreshes the display
  pyramid over the touched rectangle and re-uploads the layer's texture. With a big eraser
  over a big area that rectangle is most of the document, so the "only the touched rectangle"
  saving from phase 1 buys nothing here.

**Measured 2026-09-12** (dev instance on its own profile, the app freshly started, synthetic
15,000 × 10,000 document: base, three full-size paint layers, one 2048² result layer, a film
look; `tools/perf_test.py 15000x10000` plus a script that drove the real pointer handlers on
the screen canvas). The drawing itself is **not** slower than the screen: pan, an eraser
stroke with a 400 px tip and its release each take one 120 Hz frame (8.3 ms median, both at
fit zoom and at 1:1), slider ticks 8 ms, the release of an erase over 12,400 × 6,400 px
13 ms commit plus 1.5 ms pyramid refresh, the autosave upload of three changed layers holds
the main thread 19 ms at most (2 s wall, in the worker). What does stutter:

| Step, 150 MP | main thread held |
|---|---|
| first frame after a zoom to 1:1 (full-resolution textures) | 58 ms, once 320 ms in a real pan |
| selection change (`pushUndo` copies the selection canvas) | 62 ms |
| undo step | 99 ms |
| selection bounds scan | 83 ms, worst 754 ms |
| grow +16 / shrink / invert / feather | 321 / 180 / 70 / 135 ms |
| magic wand / bucket | 2076 / 1646 ms |
| PNG of the composite (undo of a whole layer, autosave, export) | 274 ms even with the worker |
| full composite (before a run or export) | 9 ms warm, 990 ms cold |

And the memory, which is the finding that matters: **one 15k document with three full layers
holds 4.3 GB in the GPU process** (`ed.memoryReport()`: layers 1.8 GB, display pyramids
1.0 GB, base canvas 0.6 GB, selection canvas 0.6 GB, compositor textures 0.2 GB at fit zoom
and 1.26 GB after a zoom to 1:1). The GPU process went from 8.1 GB (after the benchmark's own
15k document had been closed) to 14.9 GB with the document built and 17.4 GB after the
gestures. Every one of those canvases is a GPU texture in Chromium's GPU process, and it
competes for the card's 32 GB with ComfyUI (20 to 29 GB right after a local render, measured
on 2026-09-08), Photoshop (9.5 GB dedicated while it had a document open, WDDM counters
`\GPU Process Memory(*)\Dedicated Usage`) and Krita. When the card is over-committed Windows
pages GPU memory to system RAM and every frame that touches an evicted texture stalls: that
is a stutter no benchmark on an otherwise idle card shows, and it is the first thing to
verify on the user's machine (Task Manager › GPU › dedicated memory while it stutters, and
whether it is smooth right after a restart of ComfyUI). The user's real 15k file could not
be measured: it was not open (their autosave held a 2 MP document, their GPU process 774 MB).

**What to measure first** (before touching anything)

1. ~~The exact dimensions of both files, `ed.memoryReport()` and `app:metrics`~~ done above on
   a synthetic document of the reported size; the user's own file is still to be read the
   same way (Help › Console, `window.editor.memoryReport()`, `window.scumble.metrics()`).
2. ~~`perf_test.py 15000x10000` against 12000x8000~~ done: within a frame of the 96 MP numbers
   for every interactive row; the discrete rows are in the table above.
3. **Dedicated GPU memory of the whole card while it stutters** (Task Manager › Performance ›
   GPU, or the WDDM counters), and the same document right after ComfyUI has been restarted.
   If the stutter goes with the free VRAM, the fix is memory, not drawing.
4. A CDP heap snapshot if the memory climbs across gestures rather than sitting flat. The
   canvas census says *what* survived, only the retaining path says *why*.
5. Whether the stutter is periodic. `watchMemory` runs every 30 s but only touches background
   tabs; the autosave runs 15 s after the last change and was measured at 19 ms blocked.

**Phase A of `docs/PLAN_TILES.md` is built (2026-09-13)** and takes the discrete hitches out
of the table above: selection change 6 ms, bounds 6 ms warm, stroke undo 42 ms (the film
look's re-render; about 10 without a filter layer), grow / shrink / invert 112 / 131 / 54 ms,
the bucket and the wand on a bounded region a fraction of before, a stroke's buffers 19 MB
instead of 1.8 GB and the live preview refreshed inside the dab, the compositor's textures a
window of each source. `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §9 has the table. What it does **not** change
is the memory per document (2.3 GB of layers, 0.95 GB of pyramids, 0.57 GB base, 0.57 GB
selection canvas in the GPU process for this document), and the ops that read the whole
selection keep their phase 4 cost. Whether the stutter the user sees is that memory is still
the open question 3 above; the memory watch now reads the card as a whole (Settings ›
Rendering shows it), which is the number to look at while it stutters.

**Likely fix, if the measurement confirms the memory reading**: layer tiles above a
threshold, which is the one piece of the performance plan that was left out on purpose, and
with them the pixels of layers that are not on screen kept out of the GPU process (in the
renderer as typed arrays, or in the mirror) instead of as one accelerated canvas each. That is
what Krita and Photoshop do (`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §3: tiles in system RAM, a mipmapped
projection of the *merged* picture, the GPU holds only the visible tiles) and it is why they
do not fight ComfyUI for VRAM. A tiled layer also makes the whole-document steps in the table
(selection undo, bounds scan, wand, bucket) per-tile work. It is a large piece of work and
belongs to the user's decision, not to a quick patch. The plan for it is
`docs/PLAN_TILES.md` (written 2026-09-12): quick wins first, a Rust spike, then the tile engine.
